<h1>Advanced Settings</h1>

<p>The <b>Calculation Depth</b> slider controls how many iterations are calculated before filling a point with the background color. The number of iterations is automatically adjusted when changing the zoom level.</p>

<p>The <b>Detal Level</b> slider controls how much details of the fractal are calculated. Parts containing few details are skipped for faster generation.</p>

<h2>2D Mode</h2>

<p>The <b>Anti-Aliasing</b> option controls the post-processing level of the image which makes it look more smooth in areas containing many details.</p>

<h2>3D Mode</h2>

<p>The <b>Mesh Resolution</b> option controls the resolution of the fractal rendered in 3D mode. Higher resolutions require a fast graphics card.</p>

<p>The <b>Mesh Height Scale</b> slider controls how much the mesh is stretched vertically.</p>

<p>The <b>Camera Zoom</b> controls the zoom of the camera, making the mesh appear closer or farther.</p>
