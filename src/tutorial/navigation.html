<h1>Navigation</h1>

<h2>2D Mode</h2>

<p>The following key combinations can be used to navigate over the fractal surface using the mouse:</p>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
 <th>Keys</th>
 <th>Function</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>LMB</td>
 <td>Move the mouse away from the start point to zoom in to that point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>RMB</td>
 <td>Move the mouse away from the start point to zoom out from that point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>MMB</td>
 <td>Move the surface in any direction dragging it with the mouse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Shift + LMB</td>
 <td>Move the surface in any direction dragging it with the mouse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Shift + RMB</td>
 <td>Rotate the surface around the center dragging in with the mouse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Ctrl + LMB</td>
 <td>Move the mouse up and down to zoom in and out from the center of the surface</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Ctrl + RMB</td>
 <td>Move the mouse left and right to rotate the surface around the center</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>4th Button</td>
 <td>Navigate back to the previous position</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>5th Button</td>
 <td>Navigate forward to the next position</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Wheel</td>
 <td>Rotate the wheel up and down to zoom in and out from the point under the mouse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Shift + Wheel</td>
 <td>Rotate the wheel up and down to rotate the surface around the center</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Ctrl + Wheel</td>
 <td>Rotate the wheel up and down to zoom in and out from the center of the surface</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can also use the following keys when the fractal view is active:</p>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
 <th>Keys</th>
 <th>Function</th>

</table>

<p>You can also use the <b><img src="../icons/edit-16.png"/> Parameters</b> page to edit the position, zoom and angle of the visible part of the fractal surface.</p>

<p>While hovering the mouse over the main fractal surface, a preview of the Julia fractal corresponding to the point under the mouse is dynamically generated. Double-click on the main view to switch it to the Julia fractal.</p>

<h2>3D Mode</h2>

<p>Click <b>View &gt; <img src="../icons/view3d-16.png"/> 3D View</b> to switch to the 3D mode. You can rotate and zoom the 3D view using the mouse:</p>

<table width="100%">

<tr>
 <td>LMB</td>
 <td>Move the mouse to rotate the fractal surface around its center</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>RMB,<br />Ctrl + LMB</td>
 <td>Move the mouse up and down to zoom the view in and out</td>
</tr>
<tr>
